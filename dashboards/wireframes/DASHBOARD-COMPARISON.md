### Phase 2: Delivery Driver (Weeks 5-8)
**Why Second**:
- Leverages data pipeline from Phase 1
- Drives quality improvement at the source
- High user volume = broad impact
- Mobile-first requires different approach

**Dependencies**: 
- Batch processing pipeline (Phase 1)

## Risk Assessment

### Operations Manager Dashboard
**Risks**:
- ⚠️ Real-time alert volume could overwhelm system
- ⚠️ Geographic mapping performance with large datasets
- ⚠️ Action queue assignment conflicts (multi-user)

**Mitigations**:
- Implement alert throttling and priority filtering
- Use map clustering for performance
- Add optimistic UI updates + conflict resolution

---

### Driver Dashboard  
**Risks**:
- ⚠️ Driver adoption (they may not check daily)
- ⚠️ Mobile data usage for photos
- ⚠️ Offline sync complexity

**Mitigations**:
- Push notifications to drive engagement
- Optimize photo delivery (WebP, compression)
- Keep offline sync simple (read-only cache)

---

### Customer Service Dashboard
**Risks**:
- ⚠️ False positives (contacting customers unnecessarily)
- ⚠️ Real-time data consistency across multiple agents
- ⚠️ Customer contact integration complexity

**Mitigations**:
- Tune at-risk detection thresholds carefully
- Implement locking mechanism for case assignment
- Start with manual contact, automate in Phase 2

---

## Next Steps

1. **Stakeholder Review** (Week 1)
   - Present wireframes to Operations, Drivers, CS teams
   - Collect feedback on workflows and priorities
   - Validate success metrics

2. **Design Phase** (Weeks 2-3)
   - Create high-fidelity mockups
   - Develop component library
   - Design system guidelines

3. **Technical Planning** (Week 4)
   - Finalize database schema
   - API contract definitions
   - Infrastructure setup

4. **Development** (Weeks 5-16)
   - Phase 1: Operations Manager (4 weeks)
   - Phase 2: Driver (4 weeks)
   - Phase 3: Customer Service (4 weeks)
   - Phase 4: Optimization (4 weeks)
